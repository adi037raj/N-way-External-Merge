# N-way-External-Merge
Here , I am implementing merge sort in files sorting, As files conatins a lot of data , it cant fit in the main memory , so i am taking some data from the files and sorting them and again take next data and sort them,. By this i am creating runs and at the end you can have all the files as sorted files
