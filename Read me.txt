I have done By programming in c++.

In my program,first it asks the user to enter the no. of records, then it again ask the user to enter the size of block,which means the no. of records a block can hold, and after that it again ask the user to enter the size of memory in blocks.

My program is running fine,you can change the value of B,M and play around with it.

I have done my programming in codeblocks, so i recommend you use the same for better results.

	Now coming to NAMING convention

dataset.txt - it contains the list of all the records,intially (without sorted)

Blocks0.txt,Blocks1.txt,.....and so on- This contains all the all the blocks initally, means after creating the dataset i am dividing this in blocks and storing it in Block0.txt,Block1.txt,...and so on.

pass 1 run0.txt,pass 1 run1.txt,.......pass 2 run0.txt,pass 2 run1.txt, ..... and so on , it stores the sorted runs upto that pass

pass 1 block0.txt,pass 1 block1.txt,......pass 2 block0.txt,pass 2 block1.txt,..........and so on, it stores the intermediate blocks created while sorting 

the difference between pass 1 run0.txt and pass 1 block0.txt , is that in case of block the record size is fixed(as supplied by the user at running),and in pass 1 run1.txt , it store blocks within it.

and Atlast I am creating a file output.txt, which contains the desired result..

My program is running for any size of records, so if you enter large number then it may take some time to get the output(15 to 20 seconds)
